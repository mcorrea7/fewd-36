Hi!
</p>
<p>
I am a 2015 graduate from the Rhode Island School of Design and received my BFA in Industrial Design. I currently work as an Industrial Designer for Alz.Care, a medical device startup focused on improving the lives of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not working, I love venturing out in the world, exploring and discovering new places and things. Travelling has been a great influence in my life and has allowed me to experience many different walks of life. I also love playing tennis and swimming. I also played the piano for 13 years and have recently started getting back into it!
</p>
